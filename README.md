# CASTING-PRODUCT-SURAFCE-DETECT-USING-DL

Casting is a manufacturing process by which a molten material such as metal or plastic is introduced into a mold, allowed to solidify within the mold, and then ejected or broken out to make a fabricated part. This study aims to develop a system to distinguish surface quality from the casted images. Precise and programmed analysis of surface casted images has been considered as an effective way for the determination of defect from the casted products such as sand casting, die casting, etc. In this work, we extracted different casting products features and then applied convolutional neural network based models for the detection of the casted product is good or not. So, it observed that neural networks can capture the colors and textures of casting specific to respective, which resembles human decision-making. This model to deploy Django web framework. We experimented with different surfaces as input to convolutional neural networks for effective classification of surface defect.
